# Bird Strikes

The FAA keeps detailed record of all incidents of birds striking airplanes.
The objective of this hackathon is to pose interesting questions with respect
to this dataset and use Tableau to generate answers.

## Data

## Questions

Discuss among the team to come up with a list of N questions (N = number of team
members). Each individual is responsible for posting his or her question
at [this issue](https://github.com/bigdatahci2015/forum/issues/21).

## Report

Create a report to present your analysis of the bird strikes.
Unlike the previous hackathons where you answered the questions you asked yourself,
in this hackathon, you will be answering other people's questions. Pick N questions
(N = number of team members) raised by others. These questions should be sufficiently
distinct and different from yours.
