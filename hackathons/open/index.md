# Open

This is an open hackathon. Choose any dataset you have worked on so far and
pose new questions. Produce a complete report consisting of analysis and
visualization using Javascript / SVG. Optionally, you can choose a new
dataset you found online.

## Data

Use the `{% data %}` tag to import JSON data to analyze.

## Team

Divide your team into two smaller units of two or three. Try to balance the skills
so that each unit has someone strong in SVG and someone strong in Javascript analysis.

## Questions

Each unit needs to generate a report that addresses N question, where N is the
number of members in the unit (N=2 or 3). Each question should be a new
question that has not bee raised before. You can go back to skim others'
past reports to get a sense of what questions have not been asked before. If you
opt to use a dataset, any question is guaranteed to be new.
