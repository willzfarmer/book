# Hackathon: Classmates

The Fall 2015 Big Data HCI course is an exciting course that has attracted
students of all sorts of backgrounds. Looking around, some may start to wonder,
__who are these people?__

The objective of today's hackathon is to produce a data-driven report to provide
some insight about your classmates.

## Data

First, what data can we use?

At the start of the semester, students were asked to comment on an [issue](https://github.com/bigdatahci2015/forum/issues/1) on the course's [forum ](https://github.com/bigdatahci2015/forum) as a way to make a brief self-introduction.

The data can be downloaded using [Github's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). It's already done for you. The raw data can be seen on the next page.
