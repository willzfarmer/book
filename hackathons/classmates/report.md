As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# (Question 1)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 2)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 3)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# (Question 4)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
