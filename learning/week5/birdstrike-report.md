# Report

As a team, answer a subset of the questions submitted during the hackathon.
But instead of using Tableau, you will need to write Javascript/Lodash code
to derive your answers. Similar to before, each team member is responsible for
one question. But everyone should work together to come up with a good solution.
Your answer should consist of Lodash code and a brief writeup.
Utilize `_.map`, `_.filter`, `_.group` ...etc. Do not se any for loop.

This time, the data is not already prepared for you in a nice JSON format. You
will need to do it on your own, replacing the placeholder `birdstrike.json` with
real data.

# (Question 1) by (Name)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 2) by (Name)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 3) by (Name)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# (Question 4) by (Name)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# (Question 5) by (Name)

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
