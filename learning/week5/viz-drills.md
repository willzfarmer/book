# More Drills

This and the next page contain several exercises to set you up on a path to
become proficient in generating SVGs for visualizing data. For each exercise,
a "desired viz" is given. You need to modify the _code_ block and the _template_ block
to come up with your own solution to create a visualization as close to the
desired visualization as possible. The SVG code of the desired viz is shown to give you a target
as to what set of SVG tags and attributes you need to generate in order to render
the desired visualization. You can also see the SVG code your code generates.
You want to get your version of the SVG code as close as possible to the target SVG code.

By close, you don't need to get to the exact precision. For instance, if
you see `x='143.31413124123'` in a SVG tag in the target code, it is good enough
for your code to somehow get `x` to that range (e.g., 142, 143, 144)
to produce a visualization that look almost identical to human eyes.

Note that the solution template code is slightly modified from the previous
page in order to put all Javascript code in the same code block.
